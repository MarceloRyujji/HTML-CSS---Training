        <h3>About me:</h3>

            easily find informations about me, I love studing so I have a lot of skills, my first one is when 
            I only had 15 years old, when I had the certficate of nutrition and dietetics, after that I start my first university
            when I studied Gaming development, but I stoped the studies to come to Australia to study english, I lived in Sydney from 
            november 2015 until march 2016, after that I returned to Brazil, on this time I worked in transport industry and kep my stuides
            , on the mean time on 2017, I get a certificate on flight attendent, to have a oportunity to work with airplanes, on 
            july of 2018 I joined one of the best universities of São Paulo, my state, the university of technology of the state of São Paulo, 
            called by the acronimum FATEC, I joined on the unity Guarulhos. I am a logistics engineer graduated from FATEC Guarulhos, with 
            an academic exchange at the Universidad del Caribe, in Mexico. I had the opportunity to work for a year and a half at Randstad, providing 
            services for Microsoft. During this period, I was responsible for the University team for all of Latin 
            America, which gave me a broader view of the job market and the demands of large technology companies.
            In December 2022, I decided to take a big step in my career and move to Melbourne, Australia, to 
            study and make a career transition to the IT field. With my background in logistics 
            engineering and experience in team management, I am confident that I can bring 
            valuable skills to the technology sector.
            Furthermore, I speak English, Spanish and native Portuguese, as well as 
            having basic knowledge of Japanese. This allows me to communicate clearly and 
            effectively with people from different cultures and countries
            I'm excited to explore new opportunities in IT and apply my leadership and project management skills to help companies grow and innovate. I am available to talk and share my professional experiences.
